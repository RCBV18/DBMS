Student (Roll_no, Name, Address) 
Subject (Sub_code, Sub_name) 
Marks (Roll_no, Sub_code, marks) 
Write following queries in SQL 
1. Write an SQL query to show the names of students who scored more than 75 marks in any subject.
2. Write an SQL query to find the average marks scored in each subject.
3. Write an SQL query to display student names who live in 'Pune'.
4. Write an SQL query to list students along with total marks they obtained across all subjects.
5. Find how many students have failed in the subject “DBMS”. 
6. Construct suitable view on above schema
7. Create a stored procedure that takes a student’s Roll_no as input and returns their name, subject names, and marks.
