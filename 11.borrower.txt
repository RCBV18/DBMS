Consider database
Borrower (cust_name, loan_num, branch_name)
Depositor (cust_name, acc_num)
Branch (branch_name, branch_city, assets)
1. Display the name of the customer those are depositor as well as saving account (nested query as a depositor)
2.Display the name of the customer those are not depositor but having saving account (nested query as a depositor)
3. Select branch_name where assets are less than assets of pune.
4.Display distinct branch name
5.Check whether each loan number in the Borrower table is assigned to only one customer.
6.List the borrowers who do not have a deposit account.
7.Find the customer names from the Borrower table who also have accounts in   the Depositor table.
