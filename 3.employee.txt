Consider the employee database;
Employee (employee_name, department, street, city)
Works (employee_name, company_name, salary)
Company (company_name, city)
Give an expression in SQL for each of the following;
1. Find the names, street address, and cities of residence of all employees who work FBC and earn more than Rs. 10,000.
2. Write an SQL query to find the total number of employees in each department from the Employee table.
3. Update the company_name where city is pune
4. Write an SQL query to find the highest salary from the Works table.
5. Find the names of employees who work in the same city as their company. 
6. Create a trigger that updates the city of an employee in the Employee table
