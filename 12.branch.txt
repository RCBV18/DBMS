Consider the following Relations. It defines the schema of the database application for a bank. It manages the branches and customers of the bank. Customers take loans (borrow money) or open accounts (deposit money) at one or more branches.
Branch (B_No, B_name, B_city, asset), 
Customer (C_No,C_Name, C_citystreet)
Loan(Loan_no, B_name, amount), 
Account (Acc_No, B_name,Balance)
Borrower (C_No, Loan_No), 
Depositor (C_No, Acc_No)
Answer the following queries in SQL:
1.Find the names and address of customers who have a loan.
2. Find the total amount of balance of all the accounts
3. List all the customers who are borrowers
4. Write a SQL query to display the names of all customers who have taken a loan from a branch located in 'Pune'.
5. Display the branch name along with total balance.
